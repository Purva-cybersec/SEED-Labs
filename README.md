# SEED Lab Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my hands-on work from the SEED Lab, which focuses on building a deeper understanding of computer security through practical exercises. Each lab demonstrates the application of theoretical concepts to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, as well as understand defensive mechanisms.

## Labs

### 1. Buffer Overflow Attack and Return to Libc Lab
- Explores buffer overflow vulnerabilities and their exploitation.
- Demonstrates the return-to-libc technique to execute malicious code.
- Includes step-by-step analysis and mitigation strategies.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Lab
- Investigates the XSS vulnerability in web applications.
- Demonstrates methods for injecting malicious scripts and stealing sensitive data.
- Provides insights into securing web applications against XSS attacks.

### 3. Environment Variable and Set-UID Program Lab
- Examines the role of environment variables in security.
- Demonstrates attacks leveraging improperly configured Set-UID programs.
- Highlights best practices for securing privileged programs.

### 4. Race Condition Vulnerability Lab
- Explores race condition vulnerabilities in concurrent programs.
- Demonstrates exploitation scenarios and their real-world implications.
- Includes techniques for detecting and mitigating race conditions.

### 5. Secret Key Encryption Lab
- Focuses on the fundamentals of secret key encryption.
- Demonstrates encryption and decryption processes using various algorithms.
- Analyzes vulnerabilities and secure key management practices.

### 6. Spectre Attack Lab
- Investigates the Spectre vulnerability in modern processors.
- Demonstrates speculative execution attacks to leak sensitive data.
- Provides insights into hardware-level security and mitigation techniques.

## Learning Objectives
- Develop hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
- Understand the principles of secure software design and defensive coding.
- Build proficiency with tools and techniques used in security testing and analysis.

## Repository Structure
Each lab includes:
- Detailed lab reports documenting objectives, methodologies, and results.
- Source code and scripts for implementation and testing.
- Screenshots and logs showcasing experimental outcomes.
